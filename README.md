# TL;DR
🍭 PWA written in Next.js with TypeScript

🃏 Allows users to play black jack against the computer saving scores in localstorage so they can return later to continue the fun

# What is this? 
It's a blackjack progressive web application (PWA) written in next.js.

Being a PWA allows to: 
🚀 the application to load extremely quickly;
🚀 users to download the application to their home screen;
🚀 users to play offline; and
🚀 makes the application appear as a native application.

The app works very similar to real black jack in that:
🃏 5 decks of cards are randomly shuffled and then kept in the same order;
🃏 the dealer will play in the same manner as a house dealer in a casino; and
🃏 double points are awarded for getting "black jack" (21 from the first deal).
